# Thinklet
A note-taking app that I made from scratch.

UI design for the app:  https://www.figma.com/design/CaSEk2u5fS9THIbFCD5Z37/Akshara-Siddharthan-s-team-library?node-id=3311-2&t=baI3LDS4hpZlqwks-1

Tech Stack:

Design UI: Figma ( https://www.figma.com/design/CaSEk2u5fS9THIbFCD5Z37/Akshara-Siddharthan-s-team-library?node-id=3311-2&t=baI3LDS4hpZlqwks-1 ) 

Frontend: Flutter
Backend: Implemented a local-only backend using Hive for lightweight NoSQL storage.

*Note: This app uses Hive to store and manage data directly on the device, serving as the app's internal database (local backend).
